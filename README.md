# Mini-Chatbot
Simple Chatbot is a basic Python CLI program that responds to user messages with predefined friendly replies. It handles greetings like “hi”, wellness checks, and name queries with random responses from dictionaries. Type naturally and say “exit” to quit. Case-insensitive input processing makes it user-friendly.
